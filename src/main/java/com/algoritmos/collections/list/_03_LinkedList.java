/*
 * - Implements Queue collection
   - Every node contais the reference to next for single linked list or doubly linked list when an item contais the reference to previous and next item
   - No Randon access - you need to search sequencialy in the list
   - Not synchronized - if various threads manage the same linked list you need to do the sincronization
   - If you want to remove a item is very fast because you donâ€™t need to update de all refference just the pointers, is very fast. o(1) complexity
   - Use it to remove -heavy applications
